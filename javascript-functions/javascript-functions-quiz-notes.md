## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  The function allows code to be executed multiple times without having to rewrite it.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function definition has the function keyword, a name, parentheses containing parameters (if any), curly braces, a code block, and a return statement.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function call contains the function name, parentheses containing arguments.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  The differences are that a function definition has the function keyword, a code block, curly braces, and a return statement.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  The difference between a parameter and an argument is that a parameter is used as a placeholder, while an argument is a value that you want to be used within the function.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Function parameters are useful, because they show what information will be inputted into a function in order to achieve the desired result.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  The return statement returns the evaluated result of the function back into the global memory.
