## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `event.target`?
  The `event.target` returns the HTML element that triggered an event.

- What is the affect of setting an element to `display: none`?
  The affect of setting an element to `display: none` is that the element won't display.

- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?
  The `element.matches()` method takes selectors as an argument. It returns true if the element matches the selectors. Otherwise it returns false.

- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?
  You can retrieve the value of an element's attribute using the `getAttribute()` method.

- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?
  It would be helpful to log things to the console each step of the way to ensure that your code is working, and to find any areas that need to be fixed before you've written a lot of code that you now have to debug line by line.

- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?
  Instead you would have to write individual event listeners to specific nodes.

- If you didn't use a loop to conditionally show or hide the views in the page, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?
  You would have to write multiple conditional statements.
