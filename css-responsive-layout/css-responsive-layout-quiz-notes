## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
A breakpoint is where you want to use a media query to change the design to a bbetter one for the space you have available.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?

The advantage is that the percentage will be based on the size of the screen and allow for the page to retain it's aesthetic, where a fixed width is dependent on the number of pixels in the screen, and will not allow your aesthetic to remain as you resize the screen.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
It will win because it comes last in the stylesheet, and overrides the previous rule.
