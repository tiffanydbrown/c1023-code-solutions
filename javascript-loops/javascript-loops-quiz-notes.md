## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  The purpose of a loop is to have a particular code block run under certain conditions.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The purpose of a condition expression is for a code block to stop executing after a specific condition. This keeps the loop from looping indefinitely.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression of a while loop gets executed before any code is executed.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The initialization expression of a for loop gets evaluated before the condition is checked, and any code is run.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The condition expression of a for loop gets evaluated second, after the initialization.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression gets evaluated last.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  You can use a break statement.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The ++ operator increments a value.
