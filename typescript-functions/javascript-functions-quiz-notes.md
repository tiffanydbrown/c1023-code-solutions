## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a way to make code reusable.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The parts of a function: keyword variable(parameters) = {}

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function call: name of function(arguments if any);

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  The difference between a function call and a function definition, is that a definition has a keyword, and the curly braces containing the function block.
  A function call only needs the name and any arguments passed into the function.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is a placeholder for what may be needed to run the function. An argument is the actual data needed to replace the parameter. These are only necessary
  if you need them.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Function parameters are useful because they indicate what needs to go into the function, which also provides information to what the expected result should be once the function is run.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  A return statement ends the function, and it also returns the result of the function.
